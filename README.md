# Commodore VIC 20 Projects

This repository is where I'm compiling notes, sketches, scripts, and other project files associated with tinkering on an authentic Commodore VIC 20. While this repo is public, I am not seeking contributions. Feel free to fork this repo if you want to do anything with these project files.
